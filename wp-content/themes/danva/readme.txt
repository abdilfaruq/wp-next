  - Description: Urbanist is a low-contrast, geometric sans-serif inspired by Modernist typography and design. The project was launched by Corey Hu in 2020 with 9 weights and accompanying italics. Conceived from elementary shapes, Urbanist's neutrality makes it a versatile display font for print and digital mediums. It is currently available as a variable font with a weight axis.

  - Description: Figtree is a clean yet friendly geometric sans serif font for usage in web and mobile apps. It's light-hearted and crisp when used for text, yet still retains some punch when used in uppercase â€“ perfect for buttons and short labels. The thicker weights have a distinctly friendlier character, great for headlines of more personable brands.
